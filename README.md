# Odyschrift
Odyschrift is a method to interact with an apparatus by movements on a two-dimensional surface. On this github page we collect the Arduino sketches we are developing.
The central file is Odyschrift.ino.  

Momentary we are developing 'Vier op een rij'.

Parallel to this sketch we develop sketches for using Odyschrift also for other apps. 
Its central file will be Odyschrift.ino. 
Libraries will be attached to this central file.

* OdyVierOprij. 

will be the first one. Vier op een rij is a game. There is a board which had eight columns and five rows. There are two players. Each  tries to put four fiches on a row in the board.

The next module we will develope is OdyLezen. The user writes messages with Odyschrift on a display.
