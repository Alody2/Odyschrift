# Odyschrift
Odyschrift is a method to interact with an apparatus by movements on a two-dimensional surface. On this github page we collect the Arduino sketches we developed. 

General information about the project is found on Welder. https://www.welder.app/jurre.ongering/odyschrift.demonstrator/master/blob/Overview.wevolver and http://odyschrift.nl/tiki-index.php.
