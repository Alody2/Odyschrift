The larger project is called Odyschrift, Ody for short. In its essence Ody is a method to interact with things by strokes on a digital surface.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>This project</h3><p>A 8 years old girl - Lin - has a dyskinetic constitution. She has difficulties to control her limps and mouth, among other parts of her body. She has trained her left hand to steer her wheelchair with a joystick, and recently to steer a cursor, but it is awkward for her to combine this with other devices (knobs, keys etc.) to give commands to a computer. Ody is a good method to surpass this problem, because in Ody a chosen direction as such results in a command for the computer.&nbsp;</p><p>An effect of the dyskinetic constitution is that Lin cannot play games wherein objects have to be handled, at least not without the help of her playmates or a third person. It can be expected she will not or seldom play such games with her peers. In this project we adapt the physical version of 'Connect 4' with mechanical and electronic tools so that Lin can make the moves in the game with her joystick, while other playmates set their moves as usual. In this way she can participate in the game in a normal way.&nbsp;</p><h2>License</h2><p>The underlying interaction technic Ody is patented by the United States of America under number US 8,648,813 B2.

The board has 8 channels in it. Chips are thrown in these channels. 8 rows of windows on the channels show the chips, which are thrown. Players throw their chips alternately in the channel of their choice. The goal is to form a row of windows with the same colour. The row can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.&nbsp;</p><p>The project exists of such a board, with addition of a container above each channel, each filled with 8 chips, for each row one chip. The chips are hold on their place by a barriere. A move is made by lifting one of the barrieres so that one chip will pass to the lower part of the board. Motors take care of the lifting, the player starts a motor by means of a joystick.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a display which shows the directions chosen with the joystick.</p><h2>Why did you make it?</h2><p>The paradigm of a computer mouse cannot be used by Lin. With a computer mouse one brings a cursor to a place on the screen that stands for a command. A key is used to signal to the computer he has to execute that command. Fine motor skills are needed for the pointing and motor skills are needed to transpone the steering hand to the knobs and vice versa, which skills Lin lacks or are costly for her, at the least.&nbsp;</p><p>Apps built around the Ody manner of interaction will improve her interaction with computers. For Ody the direction chosen with the joystick is already the instruction to select a quarter of a set of instructions. At the end of a series of directions the set exists of a single instruction. That instruction is executed. No transfer of a hand to knobs or keys is needed. There is less appeal on fine motor skills.&nbsp;</p><p>We have chosen to make a physical game. It will be a visible and tangible thing in the classroom or at home. We hope that the interaction between Lin and here playmates will be improved by such a physical game, more than by games on a computer screen. Besides that, it can function as a demo of Odyschrift in a surprising and playful way.&nbsp;</p><h2>What does it do?</h2><p>The visible output of the project is a board to play Connect 4, adapted for persons who cannot throw chips in the board. The chips are already in the upperside of the board and will fall in the lower part of the board on command. The command to let a chip fall is given by moving the joystick in two directions succesive. The name of the chosen direction is printed on a display, which is also part of the board.&nbsp;</p><p>We give the directions Lin can make with her joystick names. A sequence of directions derives its name from these names of directions. Their are 8 directions, devided in 2 groups of 4 directions. The names are D, R, M , F and O, E, I, A respectively. When we give the eight channels in the board the names of the sequences needed to open them, there names will be DO, DE, DI, DA, RO, RE, RI and RA. The first of the moves is in the directions with the names D, R, M or F. The display shows the letter that indicates the chosen direction. The second move is in the directions O, E, I or A. If directions D or R are chosen, the group fo channels which name starts with D or R is selected. The second move results in the selection of a single channel out of these groups of 4 channels, names ending with O, Em I or A. Next to the eight sequences of directions/ commands to select a channel, there are eight commands for other purposes. The directions for these commands are MO, ME, MI, MA, FO, FE, FI and FA.&nbsp;</p><p>If a channel is selected a solanoid motor lifts the barriere that prevents the effect of gravity on the row of chips in the upper part of the board. At the same time the motor places a barriere before the second chip. The first chip of the row falls and appears in the next available window on the channel in the lower part of the board.&nbsp;</p><p>When there are chips visibile in 4 conneted windows the player can signal this by chosing the sequence of directions MO. The display shows the chosen directions and the meaning of this instructions, in this case 'Vier op een rij 4!'. (Dutch for 'Connect 4!')</p><p>The sequence ME is an invitation to play a new game. At the same time, it starts all the motors to lift the barrieres to open the path, so the chips will return to the upper part of the board, in case the board is turned over. The chips of the playmate leave the channel through the place where they are thrown in but Lin's chips are too large for that slot.&nbsp;</p><p>The sequence FA closes the game. FI tells the partner that the person wants to finish the game: "Bedankt, wat gaan we nu doen?' (Dutch for: 'Thank you, what shall we do next?)&nbsp;</p><p>FE opens a communication module. In this module 3 directions result in a command. In its most simple form these are numbers and letters of the alphabet. Due to the effect of her trauma, our subject cannot articulate well. With the help of this module she can point out which sound is meant, if the listener cannot figure it out. She can write in this module.&nbsp;</p><p>Another module can be opened by FO (not realised still). Here, also 3 directions will result in a command. With 3 directions 64 commands are available. These module can contain words and sentences which are needed in daily life. They will be shown on the display. Another possibility is a chess module. Lin signals which chess piece she decides to place where. The names of the sequences (DOD, DOR, DOM, DOF till FAD, FAR, FAM, FAF stand for the names of the fields of a chessboard (DOD = A8, DOR = B8, DOM = B7, DOF = A7, FAD = A2, FAR = B2, FAM = B1, FAF = A1)</p><h2>Research</h2><h3>Ody</h3><p>The idea of Ody is born on february 2, 2007. That day Alle read about an e-reader with a writing module. These module used letter recognition. But, Alle reasoned, it is not neccessary that the writer forms complete letters. The e-reader recognizes his movements as such. Forming complete human readable letters is too much effort; movements on the digitized surface will be enough.&nbsp;</p><p>Questions rose as: Which movements? How many movements are relevant? During the years that followed, Alle developed as answer:&nbsp;</p><p>The movement is a stroke to one of the corners of the screen, alternating with a stroke to one of the sides of the screen., so there are 2 groups of each four strokes. Each direction in the first group has an equivalent direction in the other group. Equivalent qua meaning, but differing in direction 22,5 grades clockwise.&nbsp;</p><p>An important reason to decide for four directions in a group, is that corners and sides can act as targets for the strokes on the digitizing surface. A screen most often has four corners and four sides. Because there are <strong>2&nbsp;</strong>groups the switch to a member of the other group stands for finishing the stroke of the actual group and starting a new stroke.&nbsp;</p><p>A designer can decide for a cycle of strokes of any length. But, in every cycle there have to be an opening to other modules, as is the case in this implementation. It has a cycle of 2, and a width of 16 commands, but it opens with FO and FA modules with cycles of 3. A cycle of 3 will be the most common length, because the wdth of commands for such a cycle is 64, enough for many applications, The inventor splits these 64 in a group of 60 special commands and 4 general commands. These general commands are used to jump to other modules, to close the application, etcetera.&nbsp;</p><p>In its most general form the group of 60 commands is seen by the inventor as the base of a number system. He sees it as the follow up of the hexadecimal system, which is in use nowadays to express binary numbers in a compact way. This sexagesimal number system is shorter, and each number of the base has a name, which stands for the moves needed to write that number in Odyschrift. This name is international, built as it is on the common known names of notes: DO, RE, MI and FA.&nbsp;</p><p>The names of the numbers are DOD, DOR, DOM, DOF, DED, ....DAF, ROD, ...., FIF. The names of the general commands are FAD, FAR, FAM and FAF. The number 0 in the sexagesimal module is in the eyes of the inventor a general command.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>Connect 4</h3><h3><strong>Step 1: Brainstorming about the concept and what is needed</strong></h3><p>We had a discussion that helped us zoom in on creating a demonstrator of Odyschrift related to "connect four" We discussed how we needed to use triggers to allow the chips to fall into the connect four playset. This movement would have to be controlled by a joystick so that Lin could control it. Frank Vloet came up with the suggestion of using a solenoid to trigger the movement. The challenge of creating a mechanism for individual chips to drop down one by one remained a central challenge for creating the game.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Step 2: Getting the Joystick running.</strong></h3><p>The joystick we chose for the prototype is a standard arcade joystick. There are two kinds of joysticks, the ones that function as potmeters, giving of a certain numerical output value based on a variety in resistance (Ohm), and other ones that basically work because they have four integrated switches which are either on, or off. We chose the arcade version that works with switches.</p><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wevolver-project-images/froala%2F1544865974418-1544865974418.png"></p><p><em>Image of the Joystick we used in the project</em></p><p>We first explores the different connections. We noticed 5 pins on the side of the joystick. We explored these pins using a multimeter and mapped the different pins that could be seen at the bottom of the joystick, to the output pins on the side of the device. We concluded that the top pin was a common ground, and that all other pins were individualy connected to one of four switches that could either be on, or off. The overview of pins has been describes in the image below.</p><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wevolver-project-images/froala%2F1548682742872-gaming_joy-pins2.png"></p><p><em>Fig: Connection scheme:</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Step 3: Designing and lasercutting the board</strong></h3><p>(All cutting files and .dxf files can be found in the folder called "lasercut".)</p><p>To visualise our idea, Alle drawed the board, using QCADCAM. We used this design to cut a model with the lasercutter at Contact, using rest materials donated by Contact. The file was in .dxf format, the lasercutter at Contact uses Adobe Illustrator. In the conversion the .dxf file was multiplied with a factor 10. Also some lines were displaced. We did not notate which variables Alex, our host at Contact, used for the cutting.&nbsp;</p><p>The model was based on chips with a middleline of 1 centimeter. We judged the resulting board as too small. Venus imported the . dxf files in her Adobe Illustrator and built a second model, now on the base of chips with 3 centimeter middleline. A board with that measures will be very large, too large. The next model will be based on fiches of 2 centimeter.&nbsp;</p><p>We start to give the chips a thickness of 3 mm. Model 1 and 2 exists of 3 layers. The material for the middle one is 4 mm thick, 1 mm more than the thickness of the chips. The other layers are 3 mm thick. Total thickness: 10 mm. To keep them together and standing 2 support structures has a groove of that 10 mm, while each layer has a groove of 3 mm, the thickness of the support structures.&nbsp;</p><p>The chips for Lin have a different shape than the chips for her companion. The last ones are round, Lin's chips has an extension, that makes them larger than the entry and the exit of the round chips.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Step 4: Chip design</strong></h3><h3><strong>Step 4: Setting up the solenoid switch</strong></h3><p>We first tried connecting the solenoid to the 5v output and ground of the arduino board. That worked. Sadly we were not able to controll the solenoid from the different output pins. This was caused by the fact that voltage of those pins were too low (only 3.3V). We therefore were adviced to use a MOSFET transistor. Such a transistor can control a higher voltage/current to the active element (in this case solenoid) We chose the IRL540N N-CHANNEL MOSFET.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Step 5: Insights from testing withe Elinde (lin) and informal caregivers.</strong></h3><p><br></p><p><em>Image of the solenoid switch. The setup also shows a MOSFET transistor</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Step 5: Let the chip fall</strong></h3><p>With the lessons of model 1 and 2 in mind, a new design is made, its basic measure is 2 centimeter for the round chips. Model 3 still has 8 channels and 8 rows, being numbers that go well with Ody. Model 3 is built with a solution in mind for the problem how to use the solanoid to let a chip fall.&nbsp;</p><p>For this model we think that a construction behind the first chip of the row of chips in the container will be part of the solution. A wheel around an axis will be turned, clock and anti-clockwise. Two barriers will be placed and lifted before and after this first chip. We changed our idea about the position of the players. The first 2 models are built for players opposite to eachother, the board between them. This model places the players next to eachother, both looking to the same side of the board.&nbsp;</p><p>A reason for this change in position is that it looks necessary to work with a frontside and a backside: the frontside to show the game and the display, the backside to carry the mechanics and electronics. Also, in this model we give the board a slope backwards to place the centre of gravity backwards so we can built the support construction for a large part on the backside. Also, a slope will be comfortable for a person who sits behind the game, or stands next to the players.&nbsp;</p><h1>20 nov 2018 // Werksessie</h1><ol><li>Display is heel belangrijk. maar pas op met plaatsing.
